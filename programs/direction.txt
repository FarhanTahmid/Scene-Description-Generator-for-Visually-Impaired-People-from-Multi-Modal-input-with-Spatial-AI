To get the paths for the YOLO model files, you'll typically need to download the following resources:

1. **Darknet Framework**: 
   - Clone the Darknet repository from GitHub:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet.git
     ```
   - This will create a folder named `darknet` containing the framework.

2. **YOLO Configuration and Weights**:
   - Download the configuration file and weights for the model you want (e.g., YOLOv3) from the official repository:
     - **Configuration file**: `https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet/blob/master/cfg/yolov3.cfg`
     - **Weights file**: `https://pjreddie.com/media/files/yolov3.weights`
   - Place these files in the respective directories:
     - `darknet/cfg/yolov3.cfg`
     - `darknet/weights/yolov3.weights`

3. **Classes File**:
   - For the COCO dataset, the classes file can be found here: `https://github.com/pjreddie/darknet/blob/master/data/coco.names`.
   - Save this file in `darknet/data/coco.names`.

4. **Palette File** (if needed):
   - This file is often used for visualization. You may find it in the Darknet repository or create one based on your needs.

After downloading, your `darknet_path` should point to the directory where you cloned the Darknet repository, and your model files should be in the appropriate subdirectories. 

Make sure the paths in your `__init__` method correctly point to these locations. For example:

```python
darknet_path = '/path/to/your/darknet/'
```

Adjust the paths in the code accordingly.
